## The Challenge
The Biolage marketing team required a new immersive e-commerce site that originally lived under the Matrix brand. The goal was to showcase a new botanical-inspired “organic” design and move away from the typical boxy storefront by emphasizing the level of engagement, interactivity, and micro-animations offered to visitors.

## The Solution
The wireframing and design for the site had to follow a L’Oréal library of reference components that is used across a number of their brands. Those components had to be pushed in terms of layout and design, with complicated overlaps and animation. An interactive hair consultation tool was designed to offer consumers a personalized product recommendation based on their hair type. Additionally, all forms of marketing communication were designed for their blog, consumer email marketing, and newsletter sign-up flows.
