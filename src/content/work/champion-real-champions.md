<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Champion needed a site experience for their Real Champions social campaign, which shares the stories of four real people who have overcome personal challenges through sport.</p>

<p>Social selling is successful because of its authenticity, so the strategy was to focus on real people (the Real Champions) and let them share their own stories in their own words and to keep their stories front and center.</p>



<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The site was built with a focus on a story-driven shopping experience. Vignettes for each athlete featured vivid action photography and narrative videos. The Champion products were introduced as supporting features of the Real Championâ€™s athletic pursuits and personal style.  Whether consumers related directly with each athletes's challenge or saw how Champion was used as an inspiration to help overcome, it was all a win-win.  The campaign was successful because of it's shoppable short documentary feel vs just using a typical social media influencer.</p>

<p>In addition to the site experience and promotion on social channels, an email marketing series was designed and develop to further promote the campaign.</p>
