## The Challenge

The Biolage team enlisted Elevate’s expertise to create a separate immersive site experience for their products outside of its parent site, Matrix. They had just rebranded and wanted Elevate to utilize the new botanical-inspired design coupled with creating a simple navigation process for the complex assortment of product collections and products.

## The Solution

With the consumer’s experience in mind, we created wireframes to ensure a clear and thorough path to drive purchases. This also included an interactive hair consultation tool that provided tailored product recommendations for a consumer’s hair type. To keep the whole experience on brand, Elevate also designed trigger and utility emails for Account Registration, Reset Password, Hair Quiz Results, Blog Highlights & Newsletter Sign-Up. 

During the visual design phase, we utilized lush botanical-inspired product laydowns, rich textured light wooden backgrounds paired with glowing fresh-faced models to draw the consumer in. To take it one step further and bring the design elements to life, we incorporated micro-animations and animated page scrolling to keep the consumer engaged.

To help the Client’s existing back-end Demandware team, we developed functional prototypes to showcase our vision for page animations and layouts. During the development phase, we participated in UAT with the Client’s IT team to ensure the finalized designs stayed true to our vision.

“The Elevate team is always a pleasure to work with and they are very skilled at what they do. I absolutely love the designs they did for our new Biolage brand website. They went above and beyond by incorporating unique elements throughout the site which really brought everything to life and they supported us through every step of the site launch.”
