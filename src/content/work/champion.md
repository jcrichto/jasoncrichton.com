<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The streetwear consumer ties closely to their image and exclusivity. The Champion LIFE brand was created to appeal to this user by avoiding mass production combined with a higher quality product. The task was to provided a storefront that focused on a smaller, high quality line of clothing that resonated with this consumer.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Interactive prototypes were built and tested in the field with real users to drive the most successful design solution. The shoppable lookbook made up of time-released collections resulted in several product lines selling out days after release. The coordination with inventory management was critical to pull this project off.  High volume orders in short durations for scheduled product launches required proper planning with the order management queue and IT.</p>
