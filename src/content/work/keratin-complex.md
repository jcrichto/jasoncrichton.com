## The Challenge
I was tasked with identifying key opportunities to improve the overall site experience to drive revenue while migrating from a legacy Magento platform to a more modern eâ€‘commerce technology stack that leaned heavily on Shopify Plus APIs. 

## The Results
**57% increase** month-over-month in site revenue

The end result was a record double-digit sales increase within days of launch.

## Technical Architecture
Going through an extensive discovery session with the client, the requirements were heavy on the marketing side. Because of these requirements, part of my effort was to architect out a CMS that would provide all the marketing requirements but allow for a tightly integrated e-commerce experience. The solution was the lean on Shopify Plus APIs to handle the cart and checkout for the site.  The site had a B2C and B2B component for the wholesale side of the business.
