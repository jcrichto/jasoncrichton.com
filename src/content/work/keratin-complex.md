## The Challenge
An antiquated technology platform, the inability to manage marketing content and declining revenues found our Client needing results, and quickly. Elevate was tasked with identifying key opportunities to improve the overall site experience to drive revenue while modernizing the entire eâ€‘commerce technology stack in the process.
