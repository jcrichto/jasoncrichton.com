						I'm Jason 👋🏻 a dad first → designer → developer → leader currently working remotely in Chicago, Illinois. I thrive on learning new things and problem solving.

						Hey, I’m Buzz. I’m Product Designer with 18+ years creative experience and a love of creating collaborative business tools. I help designers achieve success on their own terms, build tools that enable teams to work more effectively, and produce creative strategy to help businesses be awesome.

I’m passionate about solving tough customer problems by combining thoughtful research, clever technology and beautiful design — and love working with businesses who believe that design can change the world. I coach designers, I spend my day in Figma and I love being wherever the creativity is happening!

I’m also a dad to two lovely boys, husband to a talented graphic designer and a lover of the outdoors, ocean and motorbikes ✌🏼


						My dad bought our first computer (Commodore VIC-20) in the early 80s and I have been hooked to technology since. My experience is unique in that I have grown my entire life watching technology change before my eyes.  This has exposed me to change and a drive to push and explore what's next.

						With a work history rooted in brand and marketing, I’m passionate about pushing products to the next level through a design process that includes data-backed user research, rapid iteration, and visually stunning user-focused UI.

						Years of experience as a designer, art director, and creative director have helped me understand the problems that prevent creative solutions from achieving business objectives. I have a strong belief that approaching creative deliverables with a UX focus can help bridge those gaps and produce work that is efficient, pleasing, and ultimately elevates people’s experiences.
