          <em>Just a little bit about me:</em> My education background is in technology from <a href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/departments/computer-graphics-technology" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>.
          I have grown in my career from being a visual designer -> UI developer
          to a manager of a front-end UI team to architecting full marketing and
          e-commerce digital solutions. Most of my experience is in
          e-commerce, specifically in the haircare, skincare, apparel
          industries. I have worked with over fifteen L'Or√©al brands for over 18+ years.
          I have also spent a number of years working with Hanesbrands with the
          likes of Hanes, Champion, Playtex, and more.
        </p>

		<p>I have extensive knowledge in front-end technologies and how to specifically push enterprise solutions to be visually appealing, user-friendly and functional. </p>


		
        <h2 id="whatis">User Experience Engineer?</h2>
        <p>
          As my career progressed, I would often fall under the creative side or
          the IT side depending on the project, but I always lived in the middle to help tie creative to
          the technology. The title of User Experience Engineer and job description below perfectaly encapsultes the core of my responsibilities within a project.

          A UX (User Experience) Engineer is a professional who focuses on
          bridging the gap between design and development in order to create
          seamless and user-centered digital experiences. This role is at the
          intersection of user experience design and front-end development,
          combining both creative and technical skills. The primary
          responsibilities of a UX Engineer include:
        </p>
        <ol class="flow">
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Design and Development Collaboration:</strong> A UX Engineer
              collaborates closely with UX designers, product managers, and software
              engineers to ensure that the user interface and interactions are not
              only visually appealing but also technically feasible to implement.
              They help translate design concepts into functional and interactive
              user interfaces.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Prototyping and Interaction:</strong> UX Engineers often create
              interactive prototypes or mockups that simulate the user experience.
              These prototypes can be used to validate design ideas, gather user
              feedback, and fine-tune interactions before full development.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Front-End Development:</strong> They have a strong understanding
              of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They use
              these skills to implement the user interfaces and interactions based
              on the design specifications. This involves ensuring responsive design
              for various devices and browsers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>User-Centered Approach:</strong> UX Engineers prioritize the
              needs and preferences of the users throughout the design and development
              process. They ensure that the interface is intuitive, easy to navigate,
              and provides a positive user experience.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Performance and Accessibility:</strong> UX Engineers are mindful
              of performance optimization and accessibility standards. They work
              to create interfaces that load quickly and are accessible to users
              with disabilities, following guidelines like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
              Guidelines).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>User Testing and Iteration:</strong> They collaborate with
              UX researchers to conduct user testing and gather feedback on the user
              experience. Based on the insights gained, they iterate on the design
              and development to improve the product.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Cross-Functional Communication:</strong> A key part of the
              role involves effective communication between design, development,
              and product teams. UX Engineers need to convey technical constraints,
              propose feasible solutions, and ensure that the final product aligns
              with the initial design vision.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Stay Updated on Trends:</strong> The field of UX design and
              front-end development is constantly evolving. UX Engineers stay updated
              on the latest design trends, technologies, and best practices to deliver
              modern and engaging user experiences.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In essence, a UX Engineer combines the creative aspects of user
          experience design with the technical expertise of front-end
          development to create digital products that are not only visually
          appealing but also user-friendly and functional.
