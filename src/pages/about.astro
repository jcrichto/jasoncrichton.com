				<h2 class="heading-3">Background</h2>
				
				<p>I'm Jason 👋🏻 a dad  → designer → developer → leader currently working remotely in Chicago, Illinois. I thrive on learning new things and problem solving.</p>

				<p>Hey, I’m Buzz. I’m Product Designer with 18+ years creative experience and a love of creating collaborative business tools. I help designers achieve success on their own terms, build tools that enable teams to work more effectively, and produce creative strategy to help businesses be awesome.</p>

				<p>I’m passionate about solving tough customer problems by combining thoughtful research, clever technology and beautiful design — and love working with businesses who believe that design can change the world. I coach designers, I spend my day in Figma and I love being wherever the creativity is happening!</p>

				<p>I’m also a dad to two boys, a daughter🎵 and husband to a talented graphic designer and a lover of the outdoors, ocean and motorbikes ✌🏼</p>

				<p>With a work history rooted in marketing and technology, I’m passionate about pushing products and sites to the next level through a design process that includes data-backed user research, rapid iteration, and visually stunning user-focused UI.</p>

				<p>Years of experience as a designer, art director, and creative director have helped me understand the problems that prevent creative solutions from achieving business objectives. I have a strong belief that approaching creative deliverables with a UX focus can help bridge those gaps and produce work that is efficient, pleasing, and ultimately elevates people’s experiences.</p>
