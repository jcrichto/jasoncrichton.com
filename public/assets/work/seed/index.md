<h3>The Challenge <Notch /></h3>
<p>The Seed team came to us with a big challenge — to help them tell their mission-driven story. They were a fresh new brand, still developing their first season of products, and they enlisted Elevate’s help to create a website that would preview their product line and, most importantly, share their four brand pillars: promoting natural beauty, leading environmental sustainability, supporting independent american organic farmers, and preserving seed diversity.</p>

<h3>Our Solution <Notch /></h3>
<p>Elevate created a site that focused on storytelling but also kept Seed’s future ecommerce needs in mind. Before the products were available the site focused on building their CRM by collecting email addresses while growing Seed’s community in preparation for their product launch. Once the products were available, purchase functionality was seamlessly incorporated into the site.</p>
